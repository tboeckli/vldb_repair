\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problem}

The repair problem for selection rules, which we formally address in this paper, can now be formulated as follows.

\begin{definition}[Repair problem]
    Given a tuple $\tuple$ over schema $\schema$, a set of selection rules $\sruleset$ over $\schema$, and a cost model $\costmodel$ for $\schema$, find a tuple $\tuple'$ over $\schema$ such that $\tuple' \models \sruleset$ and the cost $\costmodeltuples{\tuple}{\tuple'}$ is minimized.
\end{definition}
